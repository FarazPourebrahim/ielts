#### how to use complex sentences
1. Look for a contrast in the data. E.g.
   three categories change a lot, one is
   relatively consistent (for overviews).

2. Choose an appropriate
   subordinating conjunction to start the
   sentence (e.g. whereas, despite,
   although).

3. Write about one piece of data,
   followed by a comma.

4. Write about the other piece of data.

In order to, although, even if, unless, so as to, ...

example:
+ Overall, while running, basketball and
  swimming all experienced major
  changes in popularity over the
  decade, interest in football remained
  relatively consistent.
+ Furthermore, despite interest in
  running increasing dramatically over
  the period, football stayed the most
  popular sport of choice from start to
  finish.
+ In terms of ball sports, although
  basketball figures were high between
  2001 and 2006, climbing from 55 to 61
  students, popularity then plummeted to
  just 20 students in 2008 and the rest of
  the decade.
+ As for running and swimming, whereas
  the former's popularity increased
  throughout the period, tripling to above
  60 students, interest in the latter slipped
  to 25 after an initial surge from 20 to 50.

#### negative comparison (adjective)

###### big difference

#### How to develop ideas? (3 questions: why? what kind of? what if?)
**Idea:** The function of a university should be to prepare students for work.

> **Why?** This is because many professions need employees who are equipped with
comprehensive theoretical and practical knowledge, which universities can provide.

> **What kind of** professions? For example, medical students must be given rigorous
lessons on anatomy before they become doctors, so that they can make decisions
which save people's lives.
